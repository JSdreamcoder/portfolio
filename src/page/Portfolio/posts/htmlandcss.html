        Nowadays, not only web developers and web designers, but also the
        general public are exposed to HTML and CSS through blogs and university
        liberal arts lectures. So, let's see what HTML and CSS are.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, let's look at the definitions of HTML and CSS. HTML is an
        abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language, which is a markup language
        for making web documents. CSS is an abbreviation of Cascading Style
        Sheets, which is a style sheet that stores the overall style of web
        documents. For ease of explanation, let’s take an example with a
        building. HTML is the base of a building, and CSS is design elements
        such as a paint on the exterior of the building and wallpaper in the
        room. Now let's take a closer look at HTML and CSS.

      <p>HTML can be divided into four main components.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Tag</strong>: It means a command consisting of a start tag and
          an end tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attribute</strong>:The start tag involves attributes and the
          attributes specify additional information
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content</strong>: a content exposed on the website and
          directly displayed to users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Element</strong>: We call the whole from the start tag to the
          end tag a element.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>We use the 4 components as shown in the picture below.</p>
      <img src="./images/htmlAndCss/html.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Tag names are always enclosed in < >, and end tags are appended with a
        slash. Not all tags have end tags. In the case of an element that does
        not contain content, there is no end tag. For example, the Img tag that
        loads an image has no end tag like the following sentence.
      </p>
      <h3>< img src=”file path”alt=”description of image”></h3>
      <p>CSS consists of three factors as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Selector: To determine target element in HTML</li>
        <li>property: Kind of style for the target element</li>
        <li>value: Value of the property</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We can use these three factors as shown in the following figure.</p>
