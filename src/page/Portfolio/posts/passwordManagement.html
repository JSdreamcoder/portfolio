        You may have seen a warning message that your account was accessed from
        a different country you do not know. This was that a hacker tried to
        access your account by your ID and password hacked. If the site did not
        send a warning message, it would be a dangerous moment when my account
        could be misused. Let’s find out why these problems occur and how to
        avoid them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a typical Internet user, it will be normal to log in to more
        than 10 sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Google. Because it is
        complicated to manage with different IDs and passwords for various
        accounts, you may use one ID and three or four passwords. In this case,
        when one account is hacked, the hacker will attempt to access various
        online sites using the hacked ID and password. In this process, not only
        the hacked account but also other accounts with the same password as the
        account are highly likely to be hacked. Account hacking is a very
        serious problem because you will have financial loss as well as a block
        of the account. To prevent such hacking, I will introduce two preventive
        methods that users can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it is to prevent hacking by setting a complicated password. Jeff
        Atwood provides the following guidelines:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Must be 8-32 characters long</li>
        <li>Must include at least two of the following elements:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>At least one letter(upper or lowercase)</li>
          <li>At least one number</li>
          <li>At least one special character</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Must be different than your previous five Passwords.</li>
        <li>Must not match your User ID</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no matter how well the password is created, if the hacker uses
        malicious code or public Wi-Fi, he can leak the password easily.
        Therefore, We need an additional method.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more important than creating a complex password is to make the
        password different for all accounts. Even if one account is hacked,
        other accounts are safe. However, this method has a disadvantage in that
        password management is very difficult. Since most online sites force
        password changes at least once a year, it is virtually impossible to
        manage the passwords ourselves. However, you can easily manage many
        passwords by using the Password manager that manages users' passwords. I
        recommend a password manager provided by Google. It's free if you only
        use the logged-in Chrome browser. Also, you can use it on many devices
        and the way to use is very simple. As shown in the picture below, the
        account ID and password once logged in are automatically saved. Then you
        can call it anytime.

        In addition, if you enter the Mange passwords setting, you can easily
        manage your password as shown in the picture below.

      <p>
        As hacking methods have become more sophisticated, password management
        is essential. If you have had trouble managing it, I recommend that you
        try the method introduced in this article.
